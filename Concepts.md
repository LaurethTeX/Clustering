Important concepts
=================

Astroinformatics
-----------------
I'd say that is the compuer science approach of Astronomy, everything related to applying "informatics" concepts to Astronomy, those can be data mining, machine learning, image processing, statistics.. etc etc.
This is were computer science engineers can provide powerful tools to astronomers to make their life full of discoveries!

The objetive here is to find valuable information hidden in terabytes of information.

To achieve this the Astroinformatics uses Machine Learning and Data Mining techniques.

Machine Learning (Supervised Learning)
-----------------
Is the set of techniques for interpreting data by comparing them to models for data behavior, they are often called inference techniques, data-based statistical inferences, or just plain old "fitting".
This kind of techinques are oriented to make the machine "learn" about the input data and from that infere, predict and estimate patterns. 

**Prediction of one variable based on the other variables**

Data Mining (Unsupervised Learning)
-----------------
**“The non-trivial act of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in data”**

> Quite a nice way to explain it no?, I found that definition in the [Tools for data to knowledge](http://www.usvao.org/documents/ProjectPlans/ToolsforDatatoKnowledge/Tools%20for%20Data%20to%20Knowledge.pdf) document.

**Data Mining is about what the data themselves are telling us.**

Probability Density Function
-------------------
Is a function that describes the relative likelihood for a random variable to take on a given value. The probability of the random variable falling within a particular range of values is given by the integral of this variable’s density over that range—that is, it is given by the area under the density function but above the horizontal axis and between the lowest and greatest values of the range. The probability density function is nonnegative everywhere, and its integral over the entire space is equal to one.

Cosmological principle
-----------------
The (testable) assumption that the same physical laws that apply here and now also apply everywhere and at all times, and that there are no special locations or directions in the universe.

Clustering
-----------------
 Division of data into groups of similar objects.

FITS table
-----------------
It is a file that does conform to FITS standard but instead of containing information of an image is a binary dataset, therefore you cannot read the file as usual in DS9, for example [here](http://dr10.sdss3.org/spectrumDetail?mjd=55359&fiber=408&plateid=4055) you will find an Optical Spectrum Detail.

Neural Network
-----------------

Point Spread Function (PSF)
-----------------

H II region
-----------------
A region of interstellar gas that has been ionized by UV radiation from nearby hot massive stars.
