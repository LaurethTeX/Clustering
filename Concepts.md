Important concepts
=================

Astroinformatics
-----------------
I'd say that is the compuer science approach of Astronomy, everything related to applying "informatics" concepts to Astronomy, those can be data mining, machine learning, image processing, statistics.. etc etc.
This is were computer science engineers can provide powerful tools to astronomers to make their life full of discoveries!

The objetive here is to find valuable information hidden in terabytes of information.

Machine Learning
-----------------
Is the set of techniques for interpreting data by comparing them to models for data behavior, they are often called inference techniques, data-based statistical inferences, or just plain old "fitting".
This kind of techinques are oriented to make the machine "learn" about the input data and from that infere, predict and estimate patterns.

Data Mining
-----------------
**“The non-trivial act of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in data”**

> Quite a nice way to explain it no?, I found that definition in the [Tools for data to knowledge](http://www.usvao.org/documents/ProjectPlans/ToolsforDatatoKnowledge/Tools%20for%20Data%20to%20Knowledge.pdf) document.

**Data Mining is about what the data themselves are telling us.**

Clustering
-----------------

FITS table
-----------------
It is a file that does conform to FITS standard but instead of containing information of an image is a binary dataset, therefore you cannot read the file as usual in DS9, for example [here](http://dr10.sdss3.org/spectrumDetail?mjd=55359&fiber=408&plateid=4055) you will find an Optical Spectrum Detail.

For more information and cool functions, click [here](https://pythonhosted.org/pyfits/users_guide/users_table.html), for the PyFITS table section.

Neural Network
-----------------

Point Spread Function (PSF)
-----------------

H II region
-----------------
A region of interstellar gas that has been ionized by UV radiation from nearby hot massive stars.
