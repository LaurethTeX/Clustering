Important concepts
=================

Astroinformatics
-----------------
I'd say that is the compuer science approach of Astronomy, everything related to applying "informatics" concepts to Astronomy, those can be data mining, machine learning, image processing, statistics.. etc etc.
This is were computer science engineers can help astronomers to make their life full of discoveries!

The objetive here is to find valuable information hidden in all those terabytes of information.

Machine Learning
-----------------

Data Mining
-----------------
**“The non-trivial act of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in data”**

Quite a nice way to explain it no?, I found that definition in the [Tools for data to knowledge](http://www.usvao.org/documents/ProjectPlans/ToolsforDatatoKnowledge/Tools%20for%20Data%20to%20Knowledge.pdf) document.

Clustering
-----------------

FITS table
-----------------
It is a file that does conform to FITS standard but instead of containing information of an image is a binary dataset, therefore you cannot read the file as usual in DS9, for example [here](http://dr10.sdss3.org/spectrumDetail?mjd=55359&fiber=408&plateid=4055) you will find an Optical Spectrum Detail.

For more information and cool functions, click [here](https://pythonhosted.org/pyfits/users_guide/users_table.html), for the PyFITS table section.

Point Spread Function (PSF)
