Important concepts

Astroinformatics
-----------------
I'd say that is the compuer science approach of Astronomy, everything related to applying "informatics" concepts to Astronomy, those can be data mining, machine learning, image processing, statistics.. etc etc.
This is were engineers can help astronomers to make their life full of discoveries!

The objetive here is to find valuable information hidden in all those terabytes of information.

Machine Learning
-----------------

Data Mining
-----------------
“The non-trivial act of identifying valid, novel, potentially useful, and ultimately understandable patterns in data”
Quite a nice way to explain it no?, I found that definition in the [Tools for data to knowledge][(http://www.usvao.org/documents/ProjectPlans/ToolsforDatatoKnowledge/Tools%20for%20Data%20to%20Knowledge.pdf) document.
