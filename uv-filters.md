# UV filters

The WFC3 UVIS optics and CCDs have been optimized for UV imaging. As such, the UV filters play a key role and considerable effort has been made to procure filters with the best possible characteristics, including maximum throughput, maximum out-of-band blocking, and minimal ghosts.
The UV filters include the shortest-wavelength F218W, intended for studies of the ISM absorption feature; the wide F225W and F275W for broad-band UV imaging; the Strömgren u (F336W) and Washington C (F390W) for stellar astrophysics; the extremely wide F300X for very deep imaging; and narrow bands such as F280N (Mg II) and the quad filters FQ232N and FQ243N (C II] and [Ne IV]).

In this classification we have information from two filters, UV wide and U-band.

More information about this filters can be found in the intrument's handbook [here](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/documents/handbooks/currentIHB/c06_uvis06.html#370890).

### UV Interstellar objects and components of the interstellar medium

* **Neutral atomic gas**
  * Observed in optical and UV adsoption lines of various elements towards bright background stars
  * Organized in cold (≃100K) diffuse HI clouds (cold neutral medium, CNM) and warm (≈8000 K) intercloud gas (warm neutral medium, WNM)

* **Ionized gas**
  * Diffuse ionized gas in the ISM can be traced through dispersion of pulsar signals, through optical and UV ionic absorption lines against background sources, and through emission in the Halpha recombination line.
  * UV tracing can only be done in a limited number of selected sight-lines.

  *A transition region where interstellar gas changes from a mostly neutral state to a mostly ionized state. Ionization fronts are typically found in the vicinity of hot stars and define the extent to which stellar ultraviolet has ionized the material around them.*

* **Coronal gas**
  * Hot (∼105–106 K) gas can be traced through UV absorption lines of highly ionized species (e.g., CIV, SVI, NV, OVI) seen against bright background sources. 
  * Hot plasmas also emit continuum (bremsstrahlung, radiative recombination, two photon) and line (collisionally excited and recombination) radiation in the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray wavelength regions.

  *This image is a false color picture of ultraviolet light emitted by the hot gas that comprises the coronal loops. Ultraviolet light is invisible to the human eye, but detectable by the special instruments on board TRACE. White represents the brightest ultraviolet light.*

## U-band filter

The WFC3 UVIS optics and CCDs have been optimized for UV imaging. As such, the UV filters play a key role and considerable effort has been made to procure filters with the best possible characteristics, including maximum throughput, maximum out-of-band blocking, and minimal ghosts. The UV filters include the shortest-wavelength F218W, intended for studies of the ISM absorption feature; the wide F225W and F275W for broad-band UV imaging; the Strömgren u (F336W) and Washington C (F390W) for stellar astrophysics; the extremely wide F300X for very deep imaging; and narrow bands such as F280N (Mg II) and the quad filters FQ232N and FQ243N (C II] and [Ne IV]).

Width | 51.1 nm

### U-band Interstellar objects and components of the interstellar medium

 We can find neutral atomic gas, ionized gas and coronal gas, the same as the [UV  wide filter](https://github.com/LaurethTeX/Clustering/blob/master/uvwide-Filter.md#uv-interstellar-objects-and-components-of-the-interstellar-medium).
 
 The difference between this filter and the UV wide filter is that, the number of photons passing through is lower. Specifically this filter is used for relating it with other filters and can be used to determine,
  
  * Colour
  * The Balmer Discontinuity
  * Blanketing absorpion due to heavy elements
  * Strong invividual absorption lines

 The *u* band is located entirely below the Balmer discontinuity, and above the region of the atmospheric cut off and it is wide enough to fill most of the region between these two wavelengths. With the *uvb* band information it is possible to calculate the *c1* index, therefore measure the Balmer Discontinuity and calculate the temperature (hence instrinsic colour) for hotter stars than those where the discontinuity is at a maximun (about spectral type A2), and to measure absolute magnitude (surface gravity) for those stars cooler that the maximun.

 From a combination of the Strömgren filters, we also get a measure of the star's age, through stellar evolution model calibrations.
