## Understanding wavelentgths
The electromagnetic (EM) spectrum is the range of all types of EM radiation. Radiation is energy that travels and spreads out as it goes – the visible light that comes from a lamp in your house and the radio waves that come from a radio station are two types of electromagnetic radiation. The other types of EM radiation that make up the electromagnetic spectrum are microwaves, infrared light, ultraviolet light, X-rays and gamma-rays.

Electromagnetic radiation can be described in terms of a stream of mass-less particles, called photons, each traveling in a wave-like pattern at the speed of light. Each photon contains a certain amount of energy. The different types of radiation are defined by the the amount of energy found in the photons. Radio waves have photons with low energies, microwave photons have a little more energy than radio waves, infrared photons have still more, then visible, ultraviolet, X-rays, and, the most energetic of all, gamma-rays.

### UV wide
Correspons to the UVIS/F225W filter

The WFC3 UVIS optics and CCDs have been optimized for UV imaging. As such, the UV filters play a key role and considerable effort has been made to procure filters with the best possible characteristics, including maximum throughput, maximum out-of-band blocking, and minimal ghosts.
The UV filters include the shortest-wavelength F218W, intended for studies of the ISM absorption feature; the wide F225W and F275W for broad-band UV imaging; the Strömgren u (F336W) and Washington C (F390W) for stellar astrophysics; the extremely wide F300X for very deep imaging; and narrow bands such as F280N (Mg II) and the quad filters FQ232N and FQ243N (C II] and [Ne IV]).

Characteristics | 
------------ | -----------
Spectrum | Not visible
Pivot lambda-p | 235.9 nm
Width | 46.7 nm
Peak System Throughout |  0.10
