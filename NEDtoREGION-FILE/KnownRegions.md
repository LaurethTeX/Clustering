# Known Regions

Before moving forward let's think about the objects in M83 that have been already studied and clasiffied, and for that NED survey will be our identified objects database, with this knowledge it will be more easier to interpret the results of the clustering algorithms.
Now what I did, was an idea a colleague suggested, from the NED survey identify the kind of object and according to their location in space translate this positions to a REGION file compatible with DS9. With this we are able to match our FITS images with the identified objects.

Now in order to do this correctly, first I went to [this](http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/forms/nearname.html) webpage, selected
* Object Name: **M83**
* Search Radius: **10.0 arc min**
* Format tabular data as: **Text (ASCII) table - Bar Separated Values of Main Source table**
