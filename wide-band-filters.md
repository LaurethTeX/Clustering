# Wide-Band Filters

The most commonly used WFPC2 and ACS wide filters are also included in the WFC3 filter set. In addition to a wide V-band filter (F606W), there is the Johnson-Cousins BVI set (F438W, F555W, F814W).
The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) griz filter set (F475W, F625W, F775W, F850LP) is designed to provide high throughput for the wavelengths of interest and excellent rejection of out-of-band wavelengths. These filters provide wide, non-overlapping filter bands that cover the entire range of CCD sensitivity from blue to near-IR wavelengths.
