# Narrow-Band Filters

The WFC3 UVIS channel contains 36 different narrow-band filters, covering a variety of species and most of the astrophysically interesting transitions, including Hα, Hβ, Hγ, He II, C [II], [N II], [O I], [O II], [O III], [Ne IV], [Ne V], [S II], and Ca II. The methane absorption bands seen in planets, cool stars, and brown dwarfs are also covered.
Cosmological emission lines can be detected across a range of redshifts within the bandpasses of the narrow-band filters. Each filter table lists the redshift that can be probed using the specified narrow emission lines (hence, no entries for broad absorption bands or continuum or “off” bands). These redshift ranges are offered as a guide; exact values depend on the wavelengths of the filter cutoffs.

### OII Interstellar objects and components of the interstellar medium

The emission line [OII] is present in regions of active star formation and appears commonly in the integrated spectra of galaxies (indeed, redshifts for faint galaxies are often based solely on a single line attributed to [OII]. Unlike Halpha which is redshifted into the forest of bright OH sky lines, [OII] remains in a good spectral region up to z ~ 0.8.

Young, bright stars are usually embedded in clouds of gas which are photoionized by energetic photons from these stars. The Halpha Balmer line of hydrogen at 6562.8 Å is the best tracer of star formation because in ionization-bounded HII regions, the Balmer emission line luminosities scale directly with the ionizing fluxes of the embedded stars. The Halpha line can therefore be used to derive quantitative star formation rates in galaxies.

UV radiation produced by young, massive stars shortward of 730 Å is sufficient to photoionize heavier elements such as neutral oxygen. The [OII] 3726-3729 Å doublet is the strongest feature after Halpha. [OII] equivalent widths are well correlated with Halpha, but [OII] has on average half the flux as Halpha. The [OII] doublet is the most prominent feature in the spectra of faint galaxies in the blue, and it is a prime candidate for tracing the internal kinematics of the ionized gas.
