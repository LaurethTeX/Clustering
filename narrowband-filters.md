# Narrow-Band Filters

The WFC3 UVIS channel contains 36 different narrow-band filters, covering a variety of species and most of the astrophysically interesting transitions, including Hα, Hβ, Hγ, He II, C [II], [N II], [O I], [O II], [O III], [Ne IV], [Ne V], [S II], and Ca II. The methane absorption bands seen in planets, cool stars, and brown dwarfs are also covered.
Cosmological emission lines can be detected across a range of redshifts within the bandpasses of the narrow-band filters. Each filter table lists the redshift that can be probed using the specified narrow emission lines (hence, no entries for broad absorption bands or continuum or “off” bands). These redshift ranges are offered as a guide; exact values depend on the wavelengths of the filter cutoffs.

More information about the narrow-band filter can be found [here](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/documents/handbooks/currentIHB/c06_uvis06.html#376600)

For our purposes we have information from 5 narrow-band filters and is listed below,

## OII
Corresponds to the [O II] 3726/3728 filter.

Characteristics | Value
------------ | -----------
Spectrum | Not visible
Pivot lambda-p | 373.0 nm
Width | 5.0 nm
Peak System Throughout |  0.18
Line Rest Wavelength | 372.7 nm
Minimum *cz* | -1689 Km/sec
Maximum *cz* | 2333 Km/sec

More information about the OII filter can be found [here](http://www.stsci.edu/hst/wfc3/documents/handbooks/currentIHB/appendixA13.html#310349).

The emission line [OII] is present in regions of active star formation and appears commonly in the integrated spectra of galaxies (indeed, redshifts for faint galaxies are often based solely on a single line attributed to [OII]. Unlike Halpha which is redshifted into the forest of bright OH sky lines, [OII] remains in a good spectral region up to z ~ 0.8.

Young, bright stars are usually embedded in clouds of gas which are photoionized by energetic photons from these stars. The H-alpha Balmer line of hydrogen at 6562.8 Å is the best tracer of star formation because in ionization-bounded HII regions, the Balmer emission line luminosities scale directly with the ionizing fluxes of the embedded stars. The Halpha line can therefore be used to derive quantitative star formation rates in galaxies.

UV radiation produced by young, massive stars shortward of 730 Å is sufficient to photoionize heavier elements such as neutral oxygen. The [OII] 3726-3729 Å doublet is the strongest feature after Halpha. [OII] equivalent widths are well correlated with Halpha, but [OII] has on average half the flux as Halpha. The [OII] doublet is the most prominent feature in the spectra of faint galaxies in the blue, and it is a prime candidate for tracing the internal kinematics of the ionized gas.

## The Balmer emision lines

We have two filters with there characteristics, the Hβ and the Hα + [N II].

The Balmer series or Balmer lines in atomic physics, is the designation of one of a set of six different named series describing the spectral line emissions of the hydrogen atom. The Balmer series is characterized by the electron transitioning from n ≥ 3 to n = 2, where n refers to the radial quantum number or principal quantum number of the electron. The transitions are named sequentially by Greek letter: n = 3 to n = 2 is called H-α, 4 to 2 is H-β, 5 to 2 is H-γ, and 6 to 2 is H-δ.

  In the images you appreciate a red spectral line, at a wavelength of 6563 Å (656.3 nanometers), emitted by a hydrogen atom when its electron falls from the third lowest energy level (n=3) to the second lowest energy level (n=2). The same line appears in absorption when electrons are raised from n=2 to n=3. 

The spectral classification of stars, which is primarily a determination of surface temperature, is based on the relative strength of spectral lines, and the Balmer series in particular are very important. Other characteristics of a star that can be determined by close analysis of its spectrum include surface gravity (related to physical size) and composition.

Balmer lines can appear as absorption or emission lines in a spectrum, depending on the nature of the object observed. In stars, the Balmer lines are usually seen in absorption, and they are "strongest" in stars with a surface temperature of about 10,000 kelvin (spectral type A). In the spectra of most spiral and irregular galaxies, AGNs, H II regions and planetary nebulae (PNe).

###  OII, Hα + [N II], Hβ, OIII  Interstellar objects and components of the interstellar medium

This wavelengths are located in the visual spectrum and are associated with energetic regions where stars are being born as well as reveal hundreds of thousands of stars.

![Optical](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LaurethTeX/Clustering/4b0e6683a00befb726af7d8f5aa145dac90a84c3/galactic_w44-optical.jpg)

    In this image we can see the Milky Way where the yellow represents the near-infrared observations of Hubble. [Here](http://chandra.harvard.edu/photo/2009/galactic/) you will find more information about it.
    
These wavelengths are usually realted to each other in order to get rates and calculations from them and extract characteristics from the following regions.

* HII regions
    * The best signpost for star formation regions are so-called HII regions. "HII" stands for ionized hydrogen. Once a massive star is formed it evaporates the remaining gas/dust cloud around it and starts bombarding the surrounding regions with UV photons with sufficient energy to knock the electron free of the hydrogen atoms. When the e- recombines with another H atom, the e- cascades down through the energy levels and the atom emits several photons. The most commonly emitted photon is the one when the e- drops from the 2nd excited level to the 1st - this is the "Hα" line in the red part of the spectrum.
    * To indenfity them the Hα emission line is the strongest but is also too broad that includes PNe so combinations of wavelenght rates (i.e. [SII]/[OIII]) are used to narrow the data.
* Neutral Atomic Gas (see [UV filters](https://github.com/LaurethTeX/Clustering/blob/master/uv-filters.md))
* Ionized Gas (see [UV filters](https://github.com/LaurethTeX/Clustering/blob/master/uv-filters.md))
* Planetary Nebulae (PNe)
    * Emit strong in [OII]
