# Narrow-Band Filters

The WFC3 UVIS channel contains 36 different narrow-band filters, covering a variety of species and most of the astrophysically
interesting transitions, including Hα, Hβ, Hγ, He II, C [II], [N II], [O I], [O II], [O III], [Ne IV], [Ne V], [S II],
and Ca II. The methane absorption bands seen in planets, cool stars, and brown dwarfs are also covered.
Cosmological emission lines can be detected across a range of redshifts within the bandpasses of the narrow-band
filters. Each filter table lists the redshift that can be probed using the specified narrow emission lines
(hence, no entries for broad absorption bands or continuum or “off” bands). 
These redshift ranges are offered as a guide; exact values depend on the wavelengths of the filter cutoffs.
