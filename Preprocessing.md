First Step: Data Pre-processing
=================

Why is this important?
-----------------




Software available
-----------------
For this step I recommend [Image Cube](https://github.com/sophiathl/imagecube.git),
 which use packages like [Montage](http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/index.html),
 [Sci-Kit Image](http://scikit-image.org/) and all of this is done in Python!
 
 Imagecube processes multi-wavelength astronomical imaging datasets, performing conversion to common flux units,
 registration to a common WCS, convolution to a common angular resolution, and regridding to a specified pixel size.
