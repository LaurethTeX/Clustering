# UV wide filter

Correspons to the UVIS/F225W filter

The WFC3 UVIS optics and CCDs have been optimized for UV imaging. As such, the UV filters play a key role and considerable effort has been made to procure filters with the best possible characteristics, including maximum throughput, maximum out-of-band blocking, and minimal ghosts.
The UV filters include the shortest-wavelength F218W, intended for studies of the ISM absorption feature; the wide F225W and F275W for broad-band UV imaging; the Strömgren u (F336W) and Washington C (F390W) for stellar astrophysics; the extremely wide F300X for very deep imaging; and narrow bands such as F280N (Mg II) and the quad filters FQ232N and FQ243N (C II] and [Ne IV]).

## UV Interstellar objects and components of the interstellar medium

* **Neutral atomic gas**
  * Observed in optical and UV adsoption lines of various elements towards bright background stars
  * Organized in cold (≃100K) diffuse HI clouds (cold neutral medium, CNM) and warm (≈8000 K) intercloud gas (warm neutral medium, WNM)

* **Ionized gas**
  * Diffuse ionized gas in the ISM can be traced through dispersion of pulsar signals, through optical and UV ionic absorption lines against background sources, and through emission in the Halpha recombination line.
  * UV tracing can only be done in a limited number of selected sight-lines.

  *A transition region where interstellar gas changes from a mostly neutral state to a mostly ionized state. Ionization fronts are typically found in the vicinity of hot stars and define the extent to which stellar ultraviolet has ionized the material around them.*

* **Coronal gas**
  * Hot (∼105–106 K) gas can be traced through UV absorption lines of highly ionized species (e.g., CIV, SVI, NV, OVI) seen against bright background sources. 
  * Hot plasmas also emit continuum (bremsstrahlung, radiative recombination, two photon) and line (collisionally excited and recombination) radiation in the extreme ultraviolet and X-ray wavelength regions.

  *This image is a false color picture of ultraviolet light emitted by the hot gas that comprises the coronal loops. Ultraviolet light is invisible to the human eye, but detectable by the special instruments on board TRACE. White represents the brightest ultraviolet light.*
