# U-band filter

Corresponds to the U, Strömgren u filter.

The WFC3 UVIS optics and CCDs have been optimized for UV imaging. As such, the UV filters play a key role and considerable effort has been made to procure filters with the best possible characteristics, including maximum throughput, maximum out-of-band blocking, and minimal ghosts. The UV filters include the shortest-wavelength F218W, intended for studies of the ISM absorption feature; the wide F225W and F275W for broad-band UV imaging; the Strömgren u (F336W) and Washington C (F390W) for stellar astrophysics; the extremely wide F300X for very deep imaging; and narrow bands such as F280N (Mg II) and the quad filters FQ232N and FQ243N (C II] and [Ne IV]).

## U-band Interstellar objects and components of the interstellar medium
 We can find neutral atomic gas, ionized gas and coronal gas, the same as the [UV  wide filter](https://github.com/LaurethTeX/Clustering/blob/master/uvwide-Filter.md#uv-interstellar-objects-and-components-of-the-interstellar-medium).
 
 The difference between this filter and the UV wide filter is that, the number of photons passing through is lower. Specifically this filter is used for relating it with other filters and can be used to determine,
  
  * Colour
  * The Balmer Discontinuity
  * Blanketing absorpion due to heavy elements
  * Strong invividual absorption lines

 The *u* band is located entirely below the Balmer discontinuity, and above the region of the atmospheric cut off and it is wide enough to fill most of the region between these two wavelengths. With the *uvb* band information it is possible to calculate the *c1* index, therefore measure the Balmer Discontinuity and calculate the temperature (hence instrinsic colour) for hotter stars than those where the discontinuity is at a maximun (about spectral type A2), and to measure absolute magnitude (surface gravity) for those stars cooler that the maximun.

 From a combination of the Strömgren filters, we also get a measure of the star's age, through stellar evolution model calibrations.
